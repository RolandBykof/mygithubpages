    <h1>Bridge Card Manager - User Guide</h1>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Introduction: Bridging the Gap for Visually Impaired Players</h2>
        <p>Bridge Card Manager has been specifically designed to enable visually impaired bridge players to participate in regular bridge games with sighted players. The application addresses a fundamental challenge in card games: the ability to see and manage one's own cards. Rather than requiring specialized Braille cards, this solution allows visually impaired players to join standard bridge games with regular playing cards.</p>
        
        <p>The concept is straightforward: an assistant inputs the visually impaired player's cards into the application at the beginning of each hand. The player can then use screen reader technology and keyboard shortcuts to review their cards independently and communicate to the assistant which card they wish to play. This preserves the strategic independence of the visually impaired player while enabling them to participate in standard bridge games at clubs, tournaments, or casual settings.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>How the Application Works in Practice</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Setup</strong>: The visually impaired player brings a computer or mobile device with this application installed.</li>
            <li><strong>Card Distribution</strong>: When cards are dealt, the assistant inputs the visually impaired player's 13 cards into the application using the card input interface.</li>
            <li><strong>Dummy Cards</strong>: When the visually impaired player's partner becomes the dummy, those cards can also be entered into the application.</li>
            <li><strong>Playing Cards</strong>: During play, the visually impaired player can:
                <ul>
                    <li>Use keyboard shortcuts to review their cards by suit</li>
                    <li>Navigate to specific cards</li>
                    <li>Select a card to play and inform the assistant</li>
                    <li>The card then disappears from the interface to maintain an accurate display of remaining cards</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Error Correction</strong>: If a mistake happens, the Undo function allows recovery of the last played card.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section important-note">
        <h2>Important Note for All Players</h2>
        <p><strong>Card Announcements</strong>: For this system to work effectively, all sighted players must verbally announce each card as they play it. For example, saying "Nine of hearts" or "Ace of spades" when placing a card on the table. This verbal announcement is essential for the visually impaired player to follow the game progress and make informed decisions about their own play. This simple courtesy makes the game accessible and ensures the visually impaired player has the same information as everyone else at the table.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Key Benefits</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No Internet Required</strong>: Works completely offline</li>
            <li><strong>Fair Play</strong>: Provides only accessibility, not strategic advantage</li>
            <li><strong>No Specialized Equipment</strong>: Standard cards can be used</li>
            <li><strong>Independence</strong>: Player makes their own decisions without revealing strategy</li>
            <li><strong>Accessibility</strong>: Fully compatible with screen readers</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Bridge Card Manager is designed to level the playing field by compensating only for the disadvantage of not being able to see cards. It does not:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Calculate odds or suggest plays</li>
            <li>Reveal hidden information</li>
            <li>Track cards played by other players (unless manually entered as dummy cards)</li>
            <li>Provide any strategic assistance</li>
